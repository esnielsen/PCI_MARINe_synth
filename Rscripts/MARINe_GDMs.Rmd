knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## This markdown is for the processing of MARINe long-term monitoring data for Generalized Dissimilarity Models (GDMs)

First to note that the photo tran data was too large to host on github so we have to open this from a local directory.

```{r cars}
phototransummarysd_download <- read.csv("C:/Users/erica.nielsen/Desktop/Synz/MARINe/large_data/phototransummarysd_download.csv")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
